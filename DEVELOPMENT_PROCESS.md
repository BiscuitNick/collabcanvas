## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

### **Automated Testing (6 test files)**
- **Setup verification** - Ensures test environment works
- **Authentication integration** - Full auth flow testing
- **Canvas store unit tests** - State management validation
- **Utils testing** - Helper function validation
- **Rectangle component tests** - UI interaction testing
- **Firestore sync integration** - Real-time sync validation

### **Manual Testing Focus**
- **Real-time features** - Cursors, presence, multi-user sync
