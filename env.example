# Copy this file to .env.local and adjust values for testing

# Cursor Performance Settings
# How often cursor updates are throttled (in milliseconds)
# Lower values = more responsive but more network traffic
# Higher values = less network traffic but less responsive

# How long to wait after mouse stops moving before updating cursor (debounce)
# Lower values = more responsive but more updates
# Higher values = fewer updates but less responsive

# Rectangle Drag Throttling Settings
# Minimum time between rectangle position updates while dragging (in milliseconds)
# Lower values = smoother dragging but more server load
# Higher values = less server load but less smooth dragging
