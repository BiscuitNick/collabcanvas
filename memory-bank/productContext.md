# Product Context: CollabCanvas

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Designers and teams need a simple, real-time collaborative canvas tool for:
- **Rapid prototyping** - Quick visual mockups and wireframes
- **Team collaboration** - Multiple people working on designs simultaneously
- **Visual communication** - Sharing ideas through simple shapes and layouts
- **Remote work** - Distributed teams need shared visual spaces

### Target Users

#### Primary User: Designer/Collaborator
- **Needs:** Create and manipulate shapes, see others' work in real-time
- **Pain Points:** Existing tools are either too complex or lack real-time collaboration
- **Goals:** Quick visual design, seamless collaboration, persistent work

#### Secondary User: Evaluator/Tester
- **Needs:** Test multi-user functionality, verify real-time sync
- **Pain Points:** Need to simulate multiple users for testing
- **Goals:** Validate system works correctly under load

## How It Should Work

### Core User Experience
1. **Authentication** - Users sign in with Google or email/password
2. **Canvas Access** - Large, navigable canvas workspace (64,000px)
3. **Shape Creation** - Click "Add Rectangle" to create shapes at viewport center
4. **Shape Manipulation** - Click to select, drag to move, edit properties
5. **Real-time Collaboration** - See other users' changes instantly
6. **Live Cursors** - See where other users are working
7. **User Awareness** - Know who's online and collaborating
8. **Persistence** - Work saves automatically and persists across sessions

### Key Interactions
- **Pan:** Click and drag canvas background
- **Zoom:** Mouse wheel (centers on cursor position)
- **Create:** Click "Add Rectangle" button
- **Select:** Click on rectangle
- **Move:** Drag selected rectangle
- **Edit:** Use properties panel for precise control
- **Collaborate:** Open multiple browser windows to test

## User Experience Goals

### Performance
- **60 FPS** during all interactions (pan, zoom, drag)
- **<100ms latency** for real-time sync
- **Smooth animations** for all UI transitions

### Usability
- **Intuitive controls** - No learning curve for basic operations
- **Visual feedback** - Clear selection states and hover effects
- **Error handling** - Graceful failure with helpful messages
- **Responsive design** - Works on different screen sizes

### Collaboration
- **Real-time sync** - Changes appear instantly across users
- **Conflict resolution** - Last write wins for simultaneous edits
- **User awareness** - See who's online and where they're working
- **Persistence** - Work never gets lost

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- ✅ **Performance:** 60 FPS maintained during interactions
- ✅ **Latency:** <100ms for real-time updates
- ✅ **Reliability:** Handles 2+ concurrent users without issues
- ✅ **Persistence:** State survives browser refreshes and disconnects

### User Experience Metrics
- ✅ **Ease of use:** No training required for basic operations
- ✅ **Collaboration:** Multiple users can work simultaneously
- ✅ **Cross-platform:** Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- ✅ **Accessibility:** Clear visual feedback and error messages

## Competitive Landscape

### Similar Tools
- **Figma** - Too complex for simple shapes, requires account setup
- **Miro** - Focused on whiteboarding, not real-time canvas
- **Google Drawings** - Limited real-time collaboration
- **Excalidraw** - Good for sketching, limited collaboration features

### Our Differentiation
- **Simplicity** - Focus on rectangles only for MVP
- **Real-time** - True real-time collaboration with live cursors
- **Performance** - 60 FPS target for smooth interactions
- **Persistence** - Automatic saving with Firebase backend
- **Open source** - Transparent, customizable codebase

## Future Vision

### Potential Enhancements
- **Additional shapes** - Circles, lines, text, images
- **Shape properties** - Rotation, resizing, advanced styling
- **Layers** - Organize shapes in layers
- **Templates** - Pre-built layouts and components
- **Export** - Save as image or PDF
- **Mobile support** - Touch-optimized interface
- **Real-time chat** - Text communication during collaboration

### Scalability Considerations
- **User limits** - Currently supports 2+ users, designed for 100+
- **Shape limits** - Optimized for 500+ shapes per canvas
- **Performance** - Konva.js handles large numbers of objects efficiently
- **Storage** - Firebase scales automatically with usage

## Business Context

### MVP Goals
- **Proof of concept** - Demonstrate real-time collaboration works
- **Technical validation** - Verify performance and reliability
- **User feedback** - Gather input for future development
- **Portfolio piece** - Showcase modern web development skills

### Success Criteria
- ✅ **Functional MVP** - All core features working
- ✅ **Production ready** - Deployed and publicly accessible
- ✅ **Well documented** - Clear setup and usage instructions
- ✅ **Tested thoroughly** - Cross-browser and multi-user validation
