# Project Brief: CollabCanvas MVP

## Project Overview
**Name:** CollabCanvas  
**Type:** Real-time collaborative canvas application  
**Timeline:** 24-hour MVP sprint (completed)  
**Status:** Production-ready MVP deployed  
**Live URL:** https://collabcanvas-neon.vercel.app/canvas

## Core Mission
Build a production-ready, real-time collaborative canvas application that enables multiple users to create, manipulate, and share shapes in real-time with persistent state and live collaboration features.

## Key Requirements
- **Real-time collaboration** with multiple concurrent users
- **Interactive canvas** with smooth pan/zoom (60 FPS performance)
- **Shape manipulation** (rectangles only for MVP)
- **User authentication** (Google + Email/Password)
- **Live cursors** showing other users' positions
- **User presence** awareness with online user list
- **Persistent state** across sessions and disconnects
- **Cross-browser compatibility** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Success Criteria
✅ **All MVP requirements met** - Real-time sync, authentication, persistence  
✅ **Performance target achieved** - 60 FPS during interactions  
✅ **Production deployment** - Live on Vercel with public access  
✅ **Cross-browser support** - Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari  
✅ **Multi-user testing** - 2+ concurrent users without issues  
✅ **Comprehensive documentation** - Setup guides and README

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Canvas:** Konva.js for high-performance 2D graphics
- **Backend:** Firebase (Auth + Firestore + Realtime Database)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **State:** Zustand for lightweight state management
- **Testing:** Vitest + Testing Library
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Project Scope
**Included in MVP:**
- Rectangle creation and manipulation
- Real-time synchronization across users
- Live cursor tracking
- User presence awareness
- Smooth pan/zoom functionality
- Authentication system
- Persistent state storage

**Explicitly Excluded:**
- Shape rotation, resizing, or other shape types
- Color picker (random preset colors)
- Undo/redo functionality
- Multi-select or drag-to-select
- Export/save as image
- Comments or chat
- Multiple canvases/rooms
- Mobile responsive design (desktop-first)

## Development Approach
- **Requirements-first** - Started with comprehensive PRD
- **Structured PR workflow** - 9 sequential pull requests
- **Test-driven development** - 6 automated test files
- **Performance-focused** - 60 FPS requirement drove architecture
- **Documentation-heavy** - Comprehensive setup and usage guides

## Current Status
**Phase:** MVP Complete  
**Next Phase:** Potential enhancements (shape types, mobile support, etc.)  
**Maintenance:** Production monitoring and bug fixes
