# Project Brief: CollabCanvas MVP

## Project Overview
**CollabCanvas** is a real-time collaborative canvas application built as a 24-hour MVP sprint project. The application enables multiple users to work together on a shared canvas with live cursors, real-time shape synchronization, and user presence awareness.

## Core Mission
Create a production-ready, real-time collaborative canvas that demonstrates modern web development practices and Firebase integration capabilities.

## Key Success Metrics
- ✅ **24-hour development timeline** - Completed successfully
- ✅ **Real-time multiplayer functionality** - Live cursors and shape sync
- ✅ **Production deployment** - Live at https://collabcanvas-neon.vercel.app/canvas
- ✅ **60 FPS performance** - Smooth interactions maintained
- ✅ **Cross-browser compatibility** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing** - 6 automated test files + manual validation

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Canvas Engine**: Konva.js + react-konva
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth + Firestore + Realtime Database)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library

## Core Features Delivered
1. **Authentication System** - Google OAuth + Email/Password
2. **Interactive Canvas** - 64,000px workspace with smooth pan/zoom
3. **Shape Management** - Rectangle creation, manipulation, and properties editing
4. **Real-time Synchronization** - Firestore-based shape sync with conflict resolution
5. **Multiplayer Cursors** - Live cursor tracking with user identification
6. **User Presence** - Real-time awareness of online collaborators
7. **Data Persistence** - All changes saved and synced across sessions

## Project Constraints
- **Timeline**: 24-hour MVP sprint
- **Scope**: Rectangles only (no other shape types)
- **Performance**: Must maintain 60 FPS during interactions
- **Collaboration**: Support 2+ concurrent users
- **Deployment**: Must be publicly accessible

## Current Status
**Phase**: Post-MVP (Phase 2)
**Branch**: Phase-2
**Deployment**: Live and functional
**Next Focus**: Enhanced canvas features and AI integration

## Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Firebase over custom backend** - Rapid development with built-in real-time features
2. **Konva.js over HTML5 Canvas** - Better performance and interaction handling
3. **Zustand over Redux** - Simpler state management for MVP timeline
4. **Vercel over Firebase Hosting** - Better developer experience and deployment
5. **TypeScript throughout** - Type safety and better development experience

## Success Criteria Met
- ✅ All MVP requirements completed
- ✅ Real-time sync working with <100ms latency
- ✅ Performance maintains 60 FPS during interactions
- ✅ State persists across disconnects and refreshes
- ✅ Works across multiple browsers
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and setup guides
